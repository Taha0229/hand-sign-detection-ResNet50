# hand-sign-detection-ResNet50
This is another hand sign digit detection model which classifies 6 hand sign digits. This model leverages ResNet architecture.
<br>
The ResNet architecture uses skip connections and an additive method to merge the previous layer with the future layer to deal with vanishing/exploding gradient in case of very deep Neural Networks.
